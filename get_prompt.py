You are an expert in creative text processing and poetry composition. Your task is to transform the provided random string of characters {{input text}} into a poetic output {{output}}. 
Follow these requirements: 

- The {{output}} must incorporate as many characters from {{input text}} as possible, using only letters (ignoring numbers, symbols, or special characters). 

- The order of characters can be rearranged freely. In the {{output}}, highlight the used characters in <strong>bold</strong> within words to clearly show their correspondence to {{input text}} for reader comprehension. 

- The {{output}} must adhere to this theme: the poet imagines themselves as rain, a raindrop, or any rain-related entity, deeply connected to the act or essence of rainfall. 

- The {{output}} must be imaginative, emotionally rich, and expressive, written in a romanticist style using American English and {{Chinese translation}} for each line. 

- The {{Chinese translation}} must be poetic in Chinese.  - {{output}} must be basic HTML code, NOT markdown. 

- Do not include tags like <head>,<body>, only include <p> {{input text:}}:
